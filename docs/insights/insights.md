# Nutanix Bare Metal Migration Use Case

### Overview

In response to the dynamic needs of an enterprise customer in the entertainment business, our team recently undertook a monumental project involving the migration of a massive virtualisation platform from Virtualisation to Nutanix Bare Metal in the AWS cloud environment. This ambitious endeavor encompassed over 250 workloads and was executed with a strategic focus on leveraging advanced Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation for efficiency and scalability.

#### Project Goals

The primary objectives of the project were to enhance performance, reduce operational overhead, and take full advantage of the cloud-native capabilities offered by Nutanix Bare Metal on AWS. The migration aimed to provide our client with a more agile, scalable, and cost-effective infrastructure, aligning with their evolving business requirements in the highly competitive entertainment industry.

#### Key Challenges

The migration process posed several challenges, including:

#### Complex Workload Landscape:

With over 250 diverse workloads running on the existing Virtualisation infrastructure, understanding the intricacies of each workload and ensuring a seamless transition was a complex task.

#### Downtime Minimisation:

The entertainment business demands uninterrupted services. Minimising downtime during the migration process was crucial to prevent disruptions to critical operations.

#### Optimising for AWS: 

Effectively utilizing the native features and services of AWS while maintaining compatibility with Nutanix Bare Metal required careful planning and execution.

#### IaC Adoption:

Implementing advanced Infrastructure as Code practices to automate deployment, configuration, and management of infrastructure components demanded a robust and adaptable framework.

### Solution

1. Comprehensive Assessment:

Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing Virtualisation environment to understand the workload dependencies, performance requirements, and potential areas for optimisation.

2. Migration Planning:

Developed a meticulous migration plan, outlining the sequence of workloads to be migrated, resource provisioning in AWS, and strategies for minimizing downtime.

3. Automated IaC Deployment:

Leveraged Infrastructure as Code principles to automate the provisioning of Nutanix Bare Metal infrastructure on AWS. Utilising tools such as Terraform and Ansible to ensure repeatability and consistency.

4. Workload Migration:

Executed a phased migration approach, moving workloads in batches to Nutanix Bare Metal. Monitored performance and resolved any compatibility issues during the migration process.

5. Optimising for AWS Services:

Integrated AWS-native services like Amazon RDS, S3, and Lambda to enhance the capabilities of the Nutanix Bare Metal infrastructure, optimising cost and performance.

6. Continuous Testing and Validation:

Implemented a robust testing strategy to validate the functionality and performance of workloads post-migration. This iterative process ensured that any issues were promptly identified and addressed.

### Results

The successful completion of the migration project resulted in significant improvements for the enterprise customer:

#### Enhanced Performance:

Nutanix Bare Metal on AWS provided a high-performance infrastructure, improving the overall responsiveness of the workloads.

#### Operational Efficiency:

Automation through IaC reduced manual intervention, resulting in streamlined operations and decreased human error.

#### Scalability:

The cloud-native architecture on AWS allowed for seamless scalability, enabling the enterprise to adapt to changing workloads and demands.

#### Cost optimisation:

Leveraging AWS services judiciously helped in optimizing costs while maintaining a high level of performance and reliability.

### Conclusion

The migration of a massive virtualization platform from Virtualisation to Nutanix Bare Metal on AWS with advanced IaC automation stands as a testament to our commitment to delivering innovative solutions. The success of this project not only met the immediate needs of our enterprise client in the entertainment business but also positioned them for future growth and competitiveness in an ever-evolving industry landscape.
