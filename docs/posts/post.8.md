### Proactive Networking Security Defence

In the fast-paced landscape of modern business, large organisations are increasingly turning to advanced networking capabilities to mobilise quickly, and two cloud giants, AWS and Azure, offer a robust suite of services to meet these demands.

### Hybrid Cloud Interconnects

Building networks across different domains and areas of expertise, the dependency on automation first controls is essential.
Whilst the movement to deploy services can be tempting to do so via manual intervention, quickly enabling networks to evolve with the support of pipelines and network infrastructure as code is the key. Using foundations of priciple based approvals and guardrailed automation, this means Virtualisation networks, hyperscalers like AWS and Azure and traditional services are capable of fast becoming utility commodities for all provisioned resources.

### AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs):

AWS VPCs serve as the foundation for building scalable and secure cloud architectures. organisations can design isolated and customizable networks, defining IP address ranges, subnets, and routing tables. This flexibility enables the creation of a virtualised environment that mirrors on-premises networks, allowing seamless integration with existing infrastructures.

### Network Endpoints and Gateway Load Balancers:

To ensure efficient and secure communication between various services, Azure & AWS provide network endpoints. These allow for private connectivity to cloud based services, avoiding exposure to the public internet. Gateway Load Balancers further enhance network scalability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple zones, optimising resource utilisation and ensuring high availability for critical applications.

### Azure Virtual Networks (VNets):

Azure VNets offer a similar capability, providing organisations with the means to create isolated and customizable networks within the Azure cloud environment. This facilitates the deployment of applications and services while maintaining a high degree of control over network configurations. Azure VNets also support the extension of on-premises networks, enabling a seamless hybrid cloud approach.

### Cross Connects:

For large organisations requiring dedicated and high-performance connections between their on-premises infrastructure and cloud providers, cross connects play a pivotal role. These direct, physical links provide low-latency, high-throughput connections, enhancing the overall network performance and reliability. AWS Direct Connect and Azure ExpressRoute are examples of services that enable cross connects, offering a dedicated network path for data transfer.

### Private Security and Isolation:

Both AWS and Azure prioritise security, providing robust tools and services to ensure data protection. PrivateLink in AWS enables the creation of secure and private connections between VPCs, services, and on-premises networks, minimizing exposure to the public internet. Azure Private Link serves a similar purpose, allowing organisations to access Azure PaaS services privately, ensuring data stays within the Microsoft network.

In the context of large organisations mobilising quickly, these advanced networking capabilities offer unparalleled agility and scalability. By leveraging VPCs, network endpoints, gateway load balancers, VNets, cross connects, and private security features, enterprises can establish a resilient, interconnected, and secure network infrastructure. This not only accelerates the deployment of applications and services but also ensures that data remains protected and compliant with industry regulations. As organisations navigate the dynamic landscape of digital transformation, these advanced networking solutions become integral in achieving rapid mobilization without compromising on security and reliability.
