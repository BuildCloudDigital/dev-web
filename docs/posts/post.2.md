## Observability is more than Monitoring!

Embedding observability is crucial when deploying an AWS and Azure environment to ensure optimal performance, troubleshoot issues effectively, and enhance overall system reliability. Observability refers to the ability to gain insights into the internal workings of a system by collecting and analysing relevant data.

In the context of AWS and Azure, embedding observability involves implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing mechanisms to gain a holistic view of the infrastructure, applications, and services. This is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it allows organisations to proactively detect and address potential issues before they impact users or disrupt operations. Real-time monitoring provides visibility into resource utilisation, latency, and error rates, enabling timely interventions and optimisations.

Secondly, in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment involving both AWS and Azure, embedding observability facilitates unified insights across platforms. This ensures a cohesive monitoring strategy, helping organisations avoid siloed approaches that can impede efficient troubleshooting and decision-making.

Moreover, observability supports efficient incident response by providing detailed logs and traces, aiding in root cause analysis. This is crucial for minimising downtime and improving the overall reliability of the deployed services.

With the modernisation of automation, when an event begins the method to resolve can be made remediated.
This work is unlike monitoring, it's interactive and possible with services released.
